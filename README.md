# Java Micro Projects

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains small Java applications Iâ€™ve built to apply concepts learned from the [MOOC.fi Java Programming course](https://www.mooc.fi/en/).  
Each project is self-contained and focuses on practicing specific programming skills.

## ðŸ—‚ Project List
- **MovieLog** â€“ Console-based app to log movies, rate them, and display recommendations.
- **WorkoutTracker** â€“ Tracks workouts, stores data, and displays summaries.

*(More projects will be added as I progress.)*

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated
- Java basics: variables, conditionals, loops
- Methods and parameters
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ArrayLists and collections
- File I/O basics

## ðŸš€ How to Run
